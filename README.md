# code-might
A basic clipboard application.


##To use
    cd  copy-might-master
	npm install
	npm start

##Usage
Code-might is a fairly easy to use clipboard application. Basically it preserves everything you copy. Once you click on an item on the list, it will be written to your clipboard and you can paste it. If you want to remove an item from the list, simply right click on it.
Once it is minimized it still works in the background and you can re-open it from system tray.

And that is all folks.
